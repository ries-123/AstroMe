Then, plot the curves for 3500K (e.g. Betelgeuse), 5800K (Sun), and 10000K (e.g. Vega) for wavelengths from 100nm to 2000nm. Use the usual astronomy convention that hot stars are blue, so use a blue line for the hottest star, and that cool stars are red. Use mks units throughout. Also, mark the visible wavelength range with a rainbow of vertical stripes of different colors, at least the ROYGBIV colors. Use a log-scale y-axis and make the plot look professional.*"
